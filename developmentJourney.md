What Does Matplotlib Inline Do?

Matplotlib inline is a backend command in Jupyter Notebooks that enables the rendering of Matplotlib plots directly below code cells. This means that when you execute code that generates Matplotlib plots, the plots are displayed inline within the notebook, rather than in a separate window or output cell.

This inline rendering can be useful when iterating through versions of a plot in a notebook. Since the graph appears directly below the code that generates it, it is easy to see how the changes to your code affect the result. You can use this while applying standard plot features, such as a title, axes labels, a legend, or color coding.

Beware, in some cases, you may run into memory leakage problems, an error where the memory is not freed between plotting events resulting in the figure being incorrectly plotted after changes. If you notice this as a problem, try using the .clf() and .close() methods to clear the memory from the previous plot before replotting.
